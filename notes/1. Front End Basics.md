# Front-end Basics

## 1. Basic basics

Basically the idea here is that CSS makes HTML stuff look nicer but doesn't allow for much fancy functionality on top.  Java gives you the abilty to make shit happen and change things on the page and stuff.  Pretty obvious from the following codepen.

## 2. HTML 101

* HTML is not dissimilar from LATEX in that in just encodes properties into text so it can be sent as plain text and the reformatted in a way that is readable at the other end.

* In HTML you have some 
    * **content** e.g. text which is enclosed by:
    * **tags** e.g. `<p>` which are opened and closed. Together the content and tags are referred to as an:
    * **element** e.g. `<p>Content</p>`

* **tags** can have attributes. Attributes have a *name* and *value* which is in quotes e.g. 

```html
<p class="editors-note">Content</p>
```   

* **empty elements** such as images have no content so aren't closed eg.

```html
<img src="images/firefox-icon.png" alt="My test image">
```
* **GENERAL LAYOUT**

```html
    <!DOCTYPE html>
    <html>
        <head>
            <meta charset="utf-8">
            <title>My test page</title>
        </head>
        <body>
            <img src="images/firefox-icon.png" alt="My test image">
        </body>
    </html>
```

* you always need a doctype just to make it work
* you also always wrap the whole thing in `<html>` tags
* the `<head>` includes things like keywords and a page description that you want to appear in search results, CSS to style our content, character set declarations, and more.
* `<title>` appears in the browser tab
* `<meta charset="utf-8">` is a good default which incorporates most characters from most natural languages 

## 3. Basic tags

There are two types of element which can be categorised as:

* **Block level** - which means they get their own line

* **In-line** - which means they don't

Then here are some key elements

```<h1>``` or ```<h2>``` Headers of different sizes/levels. Block level.

```<strong> ```
Demarcates strong text (defaults to bold). In-line.

```<em>```
Demarcates emphasis (default to italics) In-line.

```<ol>``` Ordered list. Will default to numbered list. Block-level.

```<ul>``` Un-ordered list. Will default to bulleted list. Block-level.

```<li>``` List item. Block-level.

## 4. Slightly less basic tags

These allow you to group content.

```<div>```
Generic container. Block-level.

```<span>```
Generic container. In-line.


## 5. Attributes

The big list: 
https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Attributes

Some key tags and attributes:

```<img>``` self-closing (no /end bit) and must always incorporate a source (src) attribute eg:

```html
<img src="https://www.lipsum.com/images/banners/black_234x60.gif">
```

```<a>``` an **anchor** element which is used for links basically eg:

```html
<a href="https://www.lipsum.com/">This is a link to Lorem Ipsum</a>
```
This does have a closer but the link address is an attribute while the content is just the displayed text. It also an inline element.

**Important that you always need the ```http://``` (or ```https```) otherwise it will look in the current folder/location where the current page is.**

This is useful of course to link between pages on your site without having to rewrite everything.

## 6. Tables

```<table>``` is the whole table element and wraps everthing

* **Header** - The header row should be wrapped in ```<thead>``` for html5 clarity. You then add the header row as a ```<tr>``` and each element is a ```<th>```.
* **Body** - The table body should be wrapped in ```<tbody>``` for html5 clarity. You then add the header row as a ```<tr>``` and each element is a ```<td>```.

```html
<table>
    <thead>
        <tr>
            <th>Header C1 content</th>
            <th>Header C2 content</th>
        </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
        <tr>
            <td>R1C1 content</td>
            <td>R1C2 content</td>
        </tr>
    </tbody>
</table>
```

## 7. Forms

Forms exist to send data. The ```<form>``` tag is a container for the whole form. The default attributes of ```<form>``` are:

* ```action="/my-form-submitting-page"```specifies where to send the data
* ```method="post"``` can be e.g. ```get``` or ```post``` a ```get``` request is for searching or obtaining info while ```post``` is for sending for example to store into a database

Within the form you then use ```<input>``` elements with different ```type=""``` attributes e.g.

```html
<form action="/my-form-submitting-page" method="post">
    <input type="text">
    <input type="password" placeholder="password">
    <input type="date">
    <input type="color">
    <input type="file">
    <input type="checkbox">
</form>
```
List of types at https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/Input

Also if you add a ```name``` attribute before ```type``` it will add the submitted data to a query string with those names e.g.

```html
<table>
    <input name="username" type="text" placeholder="username">
    <input name="password" type="password" placeholder="password">
</table>
```

If your method is ```"GET"``` input micmac as username and password as 123456 will add ```?username=micmac&password=123456``` to the output address.

You also need to label things (for accessibility and other purposes) as follows:

```html
<table>
    <label>Username:<input type="text" placeholder="username"></label>
    <label>Password:<input type="password" placeholder="password"></label>
</table>
```

Or instead of nesting them you can:

```html
<form>
    <label for="username">Username:</label>
    <input id="username" type="text" placeholder="username">
    <label for="password">Password:</label>
    <input id="password" type="password" placeholder="password">
</form>
```

Where the ```for=""``` and ```id=""``` must match for the label to link to the element.

## 8. CSS Basics

```css
selector {
    property: value;
    anotherProperty: value;
}
```

```html
<link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="app.css">
```
