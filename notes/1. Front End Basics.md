# Front-end Basics

## 1. Basic basics

Basically the idea here is that CSS makes HTML stuff look nicer but doesn't allow for much fancy functionality on top.  Java gives you the abilty to make shit happen and change things on the page and stuff.  Pretty obvious from the following codepen.

## 2. HTML 101

* HTML is not dissimilar from LATEX in that in just encodes properties into text so it can be sent as plain text and the reformatted in a way that is readable at the other end.

* In HTML you have some 
    * **content** e.g. text which is enclosed by:
    * **tags** e.g. `<p>` which are opened and closed. Together the content and tags are referred to as an:
    * **element** e.g. `<p>Content</p>`

* **tags** can have attributes. Attributes have a *name* and *value* which is in quotes e.g. 

```html
<p class="editors-note">Content</p>
```   

* **empty elements** such as images have no content so aren't closed eg.

```html
<img src="images/firefox-icon.png" alt="My test image">
```
* **GENERAL LAYOUT**

```html
    <!DOCTYPE html>
    <html>
    <head>
        <meta charset="utf-8">
        <title>My test page</title>
    </head>
    <body>
        <img src="images/firefox-icon.png" alt="My test image">
    </body>
    </html>
```

* you always need a doctype just to make it work
* you also always wrap the whole thing in `<html>` tags
* the `<head>` includes things like keywords and a page description that you want to appear in search results, CSS to style our content, character set declarations, and more.
* `<title>` appears in the browser tab
* `<meta charset="utf-8">` is a good default which incorporates most characters from most natural languages
