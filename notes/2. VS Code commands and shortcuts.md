# VS Code useful commands/shortcuts

Top list at https://code.visualstudio.com/shortcuts/keyboard-shortcuts-linux.pdf

First few from *http://briansherwin.com/blog/2015/07/my-top-five-shortcuts-in-visual-studio-code/*

## 1. Emmet abbreviations

These are great. They give you filler text and elements from shortcuts eg.

```p*4>lorem``` gives you 4 random length paragraphs

```li*5>p.item*3>lorem10``` gives you fives list items, each with three paragraphs, with each paragraph containing 10 random words

## 2. Multiple line edits at once

```<Alt>-<Click>``` on different lines and edit them all at once!

NB. need to reset the default ubuntu command for alt-click to super-click (which moves a window around by clicking on it). The line to do this is:

```shell
gsettings set org.gnome.desktop.wm.preferences mouse-button-modifier "<Super>"
```
